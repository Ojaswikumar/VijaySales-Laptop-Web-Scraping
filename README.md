# Data Collection Technique and Description

Data collection is a crucial step in obtaining valuable information for analysis and decision-making. One of the effective methods employed in this process is web scraping, a technique that involves extracting data from websites. In this context, we will explore the application of web scraping on VijaySales.com, a prominent online electronics retailer, to collect data on laptops, including their specifications, costs, EMI options, and discount offers.

## Web Scraping Overview

Web scraping is an automated method of extracting information from websites. By using specialized tools or programming scripts, data can be systematically extracted from the HTML structure of web pages. This technique enables efficient gathering of large datasets for various purposes, such as market analysis, pricing trends, and product comparisons.

## Data Collection Goals

The primary goals of web scraping on VijaySales.com for laptops include:

- **Specifications:** Gather detailed specifications of various laptop models available on the website, such as processor type, RAM, storage capacity, display resolution, and other relevant features.
  
- **Costs:** Retrieve pricing information for each laptop, including the base price and any additional costs associated with different configurations or accessories.
  
- **EMI Options:** Collect information on the available EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) plans for laptops, including interest rates and tenure options.
  
- **Discount Offers:** Capture details on ongoing discount offers, promotions, and bundled deals for laptops.

## Web Scraping Process

The web scraping process involves several key steps:

1. **URL Identification:** Identify the URLs corresponding to the laptop listings on VijaySales.com.
   
2. **HTML Parsing:** Use a web scraping tool or programming language (e.g., Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy) to parse the HTML structure of the web pages and extract relevant data.
   
3. **Data Extraction:** Define specific patterns and elements within the HTML structure to extract information on specifications, costs, EMI options, and discount offers.
   
4. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This may involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data for analysis.

## Data Description

The collected dataset will include comprehensive information on various laptops available on VijaySales.com. Each entry in the dataset will encompass product name, specifications, cost, EMI options, and discount offers.

## Conclusion

Web scraping on VijaySales.com for laptop data provides a valuable resource for consumers, researchers, and businesses seeking to analyze the market and make informed decisions. As with any web scraping activity, it is essential to respect ethical considerations, adhere to website terms of service, and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

# Data Pre-processing

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Some laptops may lack EMI options in the extracted data, resulting in missing values. To address this, missing values are replaced with "Not Available" or imputed with the most common EMI option in the dataset.
   
2. **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate entries of the same laptop model with identical specifications, costs, and EMI options are identified and removed to avoid redundancy in the analysis, ensuring accurate insights.
   
3. **Data Formatting:** The cost field is formatted to a numeric type by removing currency symbols like '$'. For instance, "$1,200" is converted to the numeric value 1200 for consistency and ease of analysis.
   
4. **Data Splitting:** For predictive modeling, the dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). This allocation allows for effective model training and testing performance assessment.
   
5. **Handling Categorical Data:** Categorical variables like laptop names are encoded using one-hot encoding. Each unique laptop name is represented as a binary column, facilitating analysis.
